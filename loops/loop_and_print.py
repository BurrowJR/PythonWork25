# Add some code inside the following for loop to print the current value of num on each iteration. Before you execute the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be printed?

for num in range(0, 11, 2): # 0 ,2, 4, 6, 8, 10
    print(num) # start, stop, step

# On line 3 a 'for' loop is initialized to iterate over a sequence of numbers in range(0, 11, 2). The 'range' function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 11 (exclusive) with a step of 2. It will generate the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
# On line 4 the 'print(num)' statement outputs the current value of num to the console. This happens for each iteration of the loop.
